1-)In this assignment, I think I have demonstrated my HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/PHP skills, 
especially the source of jQuery-UI, plugins, AJAX requests requested from me. 
At this stage, I added "Blog" and "Shop" tabs. You can access products via Shop and information 
about OWASP via Blog.
I used the following as plugins and widgets respectively:

JQUERY Plugin:
+mouseleave 
+fadeout,fadeIn
+datepicker
+imageZoom (jQuery Zoom)

[You can see the form on the Contact Us page when you hover over the "Contact Us" text and 
click on it. A little bit of magic...]

jQuery-UI widget:
+autocomplete

2-)Using XMLHttpRequest and parseQuote, I fulfilled what was asked of me in AJAX.
I think my website has improved a lot compared to the first days. 
I am very eager to develop more different projects by increasing my AJAX skills. 
Apart from that, I had the opportunity to improve myself about API vulnerabilities thanks to this project.
